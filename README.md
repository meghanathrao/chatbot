# Chatbot - A Basic Implementation

This document describes a basic chatbot application built using Streamlit. The chatbot leverages intents to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.

Running the Chatbot

1) # Requirements: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Check the requirements.txt file for details. You can typically install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
2) # Intents: The intent.json file defines the various intents the chatbot can recognize. These intents serve as the foundation for the chatbot's understanding of user queries.
3) # Execution: Start the chatbot by running streamlit run app.py in your terminal. This will launch the chatbot application in your web browser.
